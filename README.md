# Medical Imaging Experimental Assignments
My assignments and final project for Medical Imaging Techniques course (EECS4640/5640) at York University.


The course covers the book [J.L. Prince, J. Links, Medical Imaging Signals and Systems, 2nd edition, Pearson. (ISBN: 978-0132145183, 2014.)](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/medical-imaging-signals-and-systems/P200000003390/9780137982028). 
For the graduate students, it has 3 assignments [[first](./first_assignment/), [second](./second_assignment/), and [third](./third_assignment/)], one [literature review project](./LR_project.pdf), a midterm exam, and a final exam.

The course objectives for the students were (quote from the professor):
* Explain how various medical imaging modalities work in terms of engineering physics and signals & systems.
* Apply basic signal processing methods to generate meaningful medical images from raw data.
* Understand and describe the basic design of medical imaging scanners.
* Explain clinical applications of different medical imaging modalities including advanced technologies.
* Design and apply frameworks for medical image analysis
