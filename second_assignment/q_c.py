    print("""If you look at the previous diagrams, all of them have a rise in (0, 0). 
    And going deeper, the point goes higher. Eventually, in the third diagram, 
    it is higher than the peak around 23 MHz! 
    It is a pretty interesting experiment since it proves the wave is losing energy 
    and more specifically, its details. 
    Traveling through tissue, sound waves encounter variations in the density, speed of sound, 
    and attenuation of the tissue. As the sound waves penetrate deeper into the tissue, 
    they encounter higher-density and higher-attenuation tissue that slows them 
    and causes them to lose their energy. """)
